## Privacy

For self-hosted servers (i.e., when the "Is this cloud version?" switch is set to False),
Cron does not use any external APIs or collect any personal data.

For cloud.dify.ai (i.e., when the "Is this cloud version?" switch is set to True), 
Cron relies on the cron-job.org API to regularly invoke the designated Dify cloud endpoint.

When registering a cron job with cron-job.org, Cron transmits the following information to https://api.cron-job.org/jobs:

- The API key issued by cron-job.org
- The endpoint URL generated by Dify for the target workflow execution (e.g., https://randomhash1111.ai-plugin.io/cron/runOnce)
- Scheduling information (seconds, minutes, hours, days, months, weekdays, and timezone) required to trigger the specified Dify cloud endpoint

After successful registration, cron-job.org returns a cron job identifier, which Cron retains until the user cancels the job.
